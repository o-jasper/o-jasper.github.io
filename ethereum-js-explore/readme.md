Stuff to show messages, currently, but other javascript visualizing stuff.
(perhaps this warrants a separate git repo..)

There is also a 'message data deconstructor', that takes a list of data types.
TODO is to add converting forward too, bijection test, and try it.

Would be good to have a database of APIs and recognizing which contracts use
which APIs. Not sure how to do that at this point.
