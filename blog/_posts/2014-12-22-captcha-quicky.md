Synchronized captcha filling could overwhelm non-human attackers 
which can then consist only of a fraction of captchas done. This would make the
captchas a useful source of information for a
[OnePerID](https://github.com/BitVote/bitvote.github.io/wiki/1perID),

It is of course unclear if captchas can be effective; being human-easy enough
and computer-hard enough. Also when an image needs challenging, computing the 
image generation could be expensive on the consensus system.
(Possibly use cheaper ones like [hanging blocks](https://o-jasper.github.io/blog/ethereum,/hanging/blocks,/blockchain,/scalability/2014/06/03/hanging_blocks.html))
