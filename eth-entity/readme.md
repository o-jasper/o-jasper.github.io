Possibly WIP Ethereum contracts.

Reason it is here is that the files are then reachable from
[o-jasper.github.io](http://o-jasper.github.io/), i.e. alethzero.

Note that i called it eth(ereum)-entity out of a mild frustration over the
over-legalness of the term contract. A Ethereum contract is a different thing
than current connotations. However, the term stuck anyway, and
eth-entity isnt very catchy, so i am just using the word contract anyway.
