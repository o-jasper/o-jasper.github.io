# Simpler contract for simpler testing..

It is called grudging escrow because if the deal fails, the rational choice if
grudge has no value to you, is to pretend it succeeded.

Also, it just destroys value if things go wrong. It is a *bad* contract to
actually use!

### TODO

* Add time notice to ensure the merchant cannot change the deal right
  before a customers' transaction arrives.

* Have state so that when a transaction is already underway, the javascript
  doesnt send another.
  
* Refund non-meaningful-message-donations to avoid .

* Have images of waiting/smiling guys, and add a 'time of delivery',
  and if funds arent released have them turn grumpy.

* When setting up, show percentages of stake.
  Red letters if stake is bigger than total.

* Add tipping to javascript.
